#Info about the Scripts files

Some of this files are generated through [gulp](http://gulpjs.com/), you should check the README.md file on the root of the project to check how to regenerate those files. The files that are generated from gulp have the prefix **_** (like **_vendors-head.js**) to identify them. All the other files can be changed normally if needed.
